# Medical Diagnosing Web App

> A medical diagnosing web app created in 2022 as a project for my Web Development course in the British University in Dubai.

> C#, ASP.NET, and HTML/CSS were used in this project.

> A decision tree was used as the main functionality to find the diagnosis based on symptoms.

> The application is presented in a form of a questionnaire.

> Users navigate the application using the image map and the yes/no buttons presented.

> A minimalistic design, similar to the design of the [Minimalist Music Aggregator](https://github.com/Mayonaka88/minimalist-music-aggregator), was implimented.

> Enjoy :)
